Project Description

This project was done to practice Power BI using a real-world EdTech dataset. The goal was to analyse recorded lecture data and understand category-wise trends, learner preferences, and engagement patterns.
I focused mainly on analysing how course categories, sub-categories, languages, skills, instructors, subtitles, and course duration affect the number of views.
What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the dataset and created relationships in Power BI
Built dashboards to analyse course distribution, views, language usage, and skill demand category-wise
Analysed viewer preferences based on language, subtitles availability, and course duration
Identified top instructors for each category using ratings and presented them using static visuals

Tools Used
Power BI
DAX (basic)
Excel / CSV

What I Learned
Hands-on practice with Power BI end-to-end workflow
Better understanding of business-focused data analysis
How to convert raw data into clear and meaningful dashboards
